This is the first post in my blog!

Note that all blog posts are *frozen*, i.e., when we render the entire site the computations are not re-run, but rather read from the previously frozen results

Since this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.

# Section Header

H1 headers will appear as top-level navigation items on the right

## Subsection Header

H2 headers will appear as sub-level navigation items on the right.

### Subsubsection Header

H3 headers will be ignored for the navigation.
